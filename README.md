- 👋 Hi, I’m @analogdog
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded systems, especially using the Arduino IDE, tools and C++. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can! Always on the lookout for new libraries used to 
- interface sensors, displays, etc. to microcontrollers. Also trying to get a handle on FPGA technology 
- using Xilinx vivado suite.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building instrumentation for makers, students and hobbyists.
-The cost of high quality didgital scopes, multimeters and power supplies has come down so dramatically that they are easy to obtain by hobbyists, students and makers. But I think there are a lot of instruments that would be very useful, but have not yet reached the benches of those enthusiasts. Currently I am working on a sourcemeter for bench use.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
